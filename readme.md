# Data Structures & Algorithms using JAVA

This project is about understanding, implementing and evaluating popular algorithms and data structures for common use cases in programming using Java as Expository Language. Javascript implementations are part of another repo as well.

## Project BackLog

Introduction to Algorithms by
Thomas H. Cormen Charles E. Leiserson . Ronald L. Rivest Clifford Stein is Wai T. Chang

## Algorithms

We will be covering the algorithms in the following areas:

1- Searching
2- Sorting

### List of Algorithms

#### Sorting

1- Bubble Sort
2- Merge Sort
3- Quick Sort
4- Selection Sort

#### Searching

1- Binary search
2- linear search

And I will also be discussing the Big O Notations for the time and space complexity in best, average and the worst case scenarios as well for these algorithms.

## Data Structures

1- Arrays
2- Linked Lists (singly & doubly)
3- Maps
4- Sets
5- Queues
6- Priority Queues
7- Stacks
8- Trie
9- Hash tables
10- heaps (max and min)
11- binary search tree
12- graphs

## Implementation

This branch holds DSA for Java Language

## Evaluation

Important part of knowing algorithms is to know their runtimes and which algorithm is best suited for a given problem and its underlying data structure to be used as well. Thus Algorithms will be evaluated for Time & space complexity and Big O notation will be discussed for them.
